## Data Storage
The application uses MongoDB to store destination data and related attractions. Below are the schemas used:

```javascript
const attractionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    coordinates: {
      type: [Number], // Array of numbers [latitude, longitude]
      required: true,
      validate: {
        validator: function (value) {
          return value.length === 2; // Ensure the array has exactly two elements
        },
        message: "Coordinates must contain exactly two elements: [latitude, longitude]",
      },
    },
});

const destinationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    destination: { type: String, required: true },
    tripType: { type: String, required: true },
    latitude: Number,
    longitude: Number,
    attractions: [attractionSchema], // Embedded sub-document for attractions
});
```

## Environment Variables

PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_api_key_here
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
MONGO_USER=your_mongodb_username
MONGO_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
```
